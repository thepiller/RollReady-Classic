# RollReady Classic

RollReady Classic is a World of Warcraft **Classic Era** addon that helps you plan loot and be ready to roll when it drops.

- Create multiple gear wishlists per character (e.g. *Healing*, *DPS*, *Tank*, *Flasks*, etc.).
- See which items are on your lists directly in tooltips.
- Track wishlist items that **drop in your raid** in a dedicated “Drops” window, with notes and set colours.
